The most common mods for DOOM are created using the WAD and pk3 formats, which contain game data such as textures and maps. Players can load these mods using a compatible launcher or game engine, such as GZDoom or Zandronum. These engines allow for greater flexibility and modern features, such as support for enhanced graphics and multiplayer modes.

This program aims to simplify the loading of mods, making it much easier to jump into gameplay by simply choosing a mod or a "pre-set" with your configured mods, so you donâ€™t have to deal with extra folders and files. This way, you can organize your DOOM files properly without WADs and pk3s cluttering the main folder of your favorite launcher.
