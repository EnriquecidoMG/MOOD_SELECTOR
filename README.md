### What is it?
The most common mods for **DOOM** are created using the `WAD` and `pk3` formats, which contain game data such as textures and maps. Players can load these mods using a compatible launcher or game engine, such as `GZDoom` or `Zandronum`. These engines allow for greater flexibility and modern features, such as support for enhanced graphics and multiplayer modes.

This program aims to simplify the loading of mods, making it much easier to jump into gameplay by simply choosing a mod or a "pre-set" with your configured mods, so you donâ€™t have to deal with extra folders and files. This way, you can organize your **DOOM** files properly without WADs and pk3s cluttering the main folder of your favorite launcher.

### How to use it?
- Extracting the rar file o installing it, will generate a MOOD LOADER main folder with these files and sub-folders:

* Don't delete the `example.json` file, only do it when you've already created your first `preset`. 
+ Make sure you've selected the correct path for your `doom launcher` and pk3 files. 
- Select `Save Preset` and save it to the main folder of **MOOD SELECTOR**. 
* Now you can go back to the main screen and select your _custom preset_.
